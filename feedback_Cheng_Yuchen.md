## Feedback:


### Feedback Week 3:


- [ ] On https://alanayuchen.github.io/ the text is the same as in the style template. Change it to make it specific to yourself.

















### Feedback Week 4:








- [ ] File collatz.py functions as expected, but you should use pseudocode to plan and document your work.






- [ ] File powersof2.py works as intended, but could use more pseudocode for documentation




### Feedback Week 5:



- [ ] The DNA nucleotide code should also output the count for each nucleotide, in addition to showing the pie chart.
