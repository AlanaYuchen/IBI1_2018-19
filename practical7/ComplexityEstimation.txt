The complexity of the algorithm I used is n!.
I use two for loops (one within another).
Each for loop will be carried out n, n-1, n-2... times


A variable (count) is set to record the recursion times.Count += 1 after each trial until the solution is found.

The calculation of recursion times is a bit different from complexity.
Approximately to : n!(n-1)!4^(n-1)
