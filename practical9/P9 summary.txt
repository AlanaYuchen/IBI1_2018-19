Findings: 

Human~mouse
BLOSUM62 score: 1091
Normalized BLOSUM62 score: 4.914

Human~random
BLOSUM62 score: -250
Normalized BLOSUM62 score: -1.126

Mouse~random
BLOSUM62 score: -250
Normalized BLOSUM62 score: -1.126

Human and mouse SOD2 protein sequence are quite similar because they get high BLOSUM62 score.

The random sequence has the same BLOSUM62 score with human and mouse sequence respectively.


Reflection:

1. Read a BLOSUM62 txt file in to a dictionary is quite difficult. Use filename. readlines()can read the txt file into a list containing each line as a string. Uses the index to search the characters you want. Make sure there are no blank lines left in the txt file.
2. Some further improvement: develop a more user friendly interface like using 'input' or write more comments about the codes.
